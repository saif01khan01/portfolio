# This is one of the projects i have undertaken , it involves using the TurtleGraphics Jar to create methods for the turtle to navigate around the page using simple commands in a text area. 
# The jar was provided by Dr. Duncan Mullier at Leeds Beckett University 
# All of the code is in java which is my main programming language of choice.
